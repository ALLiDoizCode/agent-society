## Deferred from: code review of 21-7-dvm-node-dockerfile (2026-04-21)

- Health check doesn't verify JSON response — Static test cannot validate runtime health endpoint behavior, requires actual Docker run
- Process.env secret deletion ineffective — This is how Node.js works - env vars are process-local. True secrets require Docker-level handling which is out of scope
- rot-js dependency not explicitly bundled — Relies on transitive inclusion through pet-dvm, can verify at Docker build time

## Deferred from: code review of 21-8-fastify-rest-websocket-metrics-api (2026-04-21)

- `saveConfig` re-validates full config on every write — migration hazard if future required fields are added (config-schema evolution concern, not 21.8) [packages/townhouse/src/config/loader.ts]
- `saveConfig` atomic-rename cross-device / Windows semantics — Townhouse is Linux-first per epic scope
- Module-level `isMutating` + `resetConfigMutex` test-seam export — behaviorally correct for single-process v1; refactor into factory-scoped closure [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-patch.ts]

## Deferred from: code review of 21-8-fastify-rest-websocket-metrics-api (2026-04-21)

- `cli.test.ts:114-115` and `cli-wallet.test.ts:95-96` MockInstance generics mismatch — pre-existing vitest typing issue unrelated to 21.8.
- `connector/config-generator.test.ts:93,194` possibly-undefined access — pre-existing.
- `wallet/manager.test.ts:229,232` index-signature cast — pre-existing.
- `buildCorsOptions` omits `HEAD` from methods — low severity; no caller uses HEAD today.
- `server.ts` error handler leaks `error.message` outside production — matches spec Dev Note intent (log full error server-side, return safe message); message leak is low risk given loopback-only bind.
